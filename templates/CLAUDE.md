## Search Preferences

- Prefer `rg` (ripgrep) over `grep` for searching file contents. `rg` is already installed on this system.

## Tools

- **Web browsing**: Use `agent-browser` to browse and interact with web pages using a real browser when `WebFetch` fails (JS-rendered pages, auth, SPAs). See the `/agent-browser` skill for usage details.
- **File upload**: To send a file to the user in Discord, include `[send_file: /absolute/path/to/file]` in your response. The file must exist on disk. Multiple files can be sent by including multiple tags.
